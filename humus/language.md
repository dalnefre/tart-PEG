# Actor Language Design

This document describes considerations for the design of a language for actor-oriented programming.

## What is actor-oriented programming?

The [Actor Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) describes computation by passing asynchronous messages between opaque computational elements (actors).
In response to a message that it receives, an actor can make local decisions, create more actors, send more messages, and designate how to respond to the next message received.
Since actor implementations are opaque, the "state" of an actor may only be inferred from its response to messages.

## Where are actors most useful?

## Why a new language?

## Primary language goals

## Key Questions

### How is an actor's state/behavior represented?
### What are the semantics of actor message-passing?

## Minimalism

The Actor Model is defined in terms of three primitive actions: **send**, **create**, and **become**.
A **send** action adds a pending _event_ to the configuration, consisting of a _message_ and a target actor _address_.
A **create** action adds a new actor to the configuration, with a uniquely defined _address_ and an initial _behavior_.
A **become** action, executed as part of an actor's _behavior_, designates a new _behavior_ for handling subsequent _messages_ to this actor.
Actor computation consists of taking an _event_ from the set of pending events 
and invoking the _behavior_ of the target actor to process the _message_.

### Formal Semantics

An actor _configuration_ consists of a set of pending _events_ **Q**, 
and a set of actors **A** mapping each actor's _address_ to its current _behavior_.
Note that **send** generates a unique _event_, even if it duplicates an existing target _address_ and _message_ pair.

    Action                       | Effect
    -----------------------------|------------------------------------------
    **send** _address_ _message_ | **Q** + <_address_, _message_>
    **create** _behavior_        | **A** + (_address_ -> _behavior_)
    **become** _behavior_        | **A** \| (`SELF` -> _behavior_)

The unique _address_ generated by **create** (designating the newly created actor) is made available to the currently executing actor.
The keyword `SELF` designates the address of the currently executing actor.
